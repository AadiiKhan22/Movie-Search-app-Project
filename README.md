# Movie-Search-app-Project
Using the OMDb API, the app fetches and displays movie details such as title, release year, IMDb rating, and a poster image. Users can input a movie name, select a genre or year, and view a list of movies matching their search criteria. The app dynamically updates the results and displays relevant movie information.
